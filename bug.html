I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had correctly installed and configured Tailwind, and the classes were being referenced in my HTML, but they didn't seem to affect the styles. This was particularly frustrating because other Tailwind classes were working fine.
